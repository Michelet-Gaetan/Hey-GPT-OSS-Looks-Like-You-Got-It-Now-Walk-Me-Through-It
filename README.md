This GitHub page hosts all the codes and data used for the experiment described in the paper "Hey GPT-OSS, Looks Like You Got It – Now Walk Me Through It! An Assessment of the Reasoning Language Models Chain of Thought Mechanism for Digital Forensics". You can the pre-print of the paper here: [Hey GPT-OSS, Looks Like You Got It – Now Walk Me Through It! An Assessment of the Reasoning Language Models Chain of Thought Mechanism for Digital Forensics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04254). The link will be uploaded once the paper is published.


The experiment can be divided in three steps: the text generation, the evaluation, and the results analysis.


In each folder you will find another README.md detailing important elements for a given step.


Appendices were moved from the paper to this README file.
