# Evaluation
In this part of the project, the workload was distributed between three investigatiors and evaluated using the metrics described in the paper.

## Data

### ./data_without_eval/
This is the elements extracted from the previous step. They serve as a basis for the evaluation and will be enriched with the manually evaluated metrics.

### ./data/data_with_eval
These are the final files containing all the evaluated metrics for each sample. They serve as an input for the next step.

## Evaluation
For the reasoning, all the metrics are defined in the paper. For the final answer, the justification is left to the evaluator, and expected answer to the questions are described in correctness_evaluation.txt.
